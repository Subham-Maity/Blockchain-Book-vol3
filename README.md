## 1. Tiers of Blockchain Technology
- **Blockchain 1.0** â€“ Deal with normal transactions but do not have the ability to handle smart contracts.
- **Blockchain 2.0** - Deal with smart contracts but do not have the ability to handle data privacy. Ethereum is an example of this.
- **Blockchain 3.0** - Applications that are built on top of Blockchain 2.0 that can handle data privacy.
  Example of Blockchain 3.0 is the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).

## 2. Type of Blockchain Technology
- **Public Blockchains** - Anyone can join the network and participate in the consensus process. Examples of public blockchains are [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), Ethereum, and Ripple.
- **Private Blockchains** - Only a select group of people can join the network and participate in the consensus process. Examples of private blockchains are [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).
- **Distributed Ledger** - A distributed ledger is a database that is shared across a network of computers. It is a type of database that is replicated across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. Examples of distributed ledgers are [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).
-  **Consortium Blockchain** - A consortium blockchain is a private blockchain that is shared by a group of organizations. Examples of consortium blockchains are [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).
- **Tokenized Blockchains** - A tokenized blockchain is a blockchain that is used to issue tokens. Examples of tokenized blockchains are [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), Ethereum, and Ripple. It is also known as a cryptocurrency.
