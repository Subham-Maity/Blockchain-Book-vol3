I love Programming. One of the aims I had when I started ```CodeXam``` was to make learning programming easy.

## 1. Tiers of Blockchain Technology
- **Blockchain 1.0** â€“ Deal with normal transactions but do not have the ability to handle smart contracts.
- **Blockchain 2.0** - Deal with smart contracts but do not have the ability to handle data privacy. Ethereum is an example of this.
- **Blockchain 3.0** - Applications that are built on top of Blockchain 2.0 that can handle data privacy.
  Example of Blockchain 3.0 is the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).

## 2. Type of Blockchain Technology
- **Public Blockchains** - Anyone can join the network and participate in the consensus process. Examples of public blockchains are [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), Ethereum, and Ripple.
- **Private Blockchains** - Only a select group of people can join the network and participate in the consensus process. Examples of private blockchains are [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).
- **Distributed Ledger** - A distributed ledger is a database that is shared across a network of computers. It is a type of database that is replicated across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. Examples of distributed ledgers are [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).
-  **Consortium Blockchain** - The term "consortium blockchain" refers to a group of private blockchains, each owned by individual institutions that have banded together to share information to improve existing workflows, transparency and accountability. Examples of consortium blockchains are [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).
- **Tokenized Blockchains** - A tokenized blockchain is a blockchain that is used to issue tokens. Examples of tokenized blockchains are [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), Ethereum, and Ripple. It is also known as a cryptocurrency. 

## 3. Consensus Algorithms 
#### Consensus means that everyone agrees on the current state of the system and no one can make changes. For a ledger to be updated, the network needs to come to consensus using an algorithm

1. **Proof of Work** - Etherium 1.0 -  Proof of work is a consensus algorithm that requires miners to solve a computationally difficult puzzle in order to validate a block of transactions and receive a reward. The puzzle that needs to be solved is to find a number that, when combined with the data in the block, produces a hash that is below a given target. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the block to the blockchain and claim the reward. The block cannot be changed after it has been added to the blockchain. This is the algorithm used by Bitcoin.


- what is  mining? 
   - Mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions or blockchain. This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.

- Who is the miner and what is the reward?
   - Miners are the people who are responsible for the security of the blockchain. They are the ones who are responsible for adding new blocks to the blockchain. The reward is the amount of bitcoin that the miner gets for adding a new block to the blockchain. The reward is halved every 210,000 blocks. The reward is currently 12.5 BTC.

2. **Proof of Stake** - Etherium 2.0 - Proof of stake is a consensus algorithm that requires a user to show ownership of a certain amount of currency to participate in the consensus process. The user with the most currency has the highest probability of being chosen to validate the next block. The probability of being chosen is proportional to the amount of currency the user owns. This is the algorithm used by Etherium.

- Who is validator and what is the reward?
   - Validators are the people who are responsible for the security of the blockchain. They are the ones who are responsible for adding new blocks to the blockchain. The reward is the amount of ether that the validator gets for adding a new block to the blockchain. The reward is halved every 4 years. The reward is currently 2 ETH.
- How much they should pay to be a validator?
   - The amount of ether that a validator needs to pay to be a validator is called the validator deposit. The validator deposit is the amount of ether that the validator needs to put into the smart contract. The validator deposit is used to prevent malicious validators from joining the network. The validator deposit is currently 32 ETH because if he is doing something malicious, he will lose 32 ETH.
   - When a validator wants to leave the network, they need to wait for 2 withdrawal periods. The withdrawal period is the amount of time that a validator needs to wait before they can withdraw their ether. The withdrawal period is currently 2 weeks. 

3. **Practical BYZANTINE Fault Tolerance** - Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a consensus algorithm that is used to achieve agreement among a group of processes in a distributed system. It is a fault-tolerant protocol for solving the consensus problem in the asynchronous message-passing model. This is the algorithm used by Hyperledger Fabric.

- What is the Byzantine General Problem?
   - The Byzantine General Problem is a problem that occurs when a group of people are trying to reach a consensus. The problem occurs when some people in the group are malicious. The malicious people can lie, cheat, or steal. The problem is that the group of people cannot tell which people are malicious and which people are not. The problem is that the group of people cannot reach a consensus because they cannot trust each other.
- What is the Byzantine Fault Tolerance?
   - Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a consensus algorithm that is used to solve the Byzantine General Problem. The algorithm is used to solve the problem when some people in the group are malicious. The algorithm is used to solve the problem when the group of people cannot tell which people are malicious and which people are not. The algorithm is used to solve the problem when the group of people cannot reach a consensus because they cannot trust each other.
   - Suppose one third of the people in the group are malicious. The algorithm is used to solve the problem when the group of people cannot tell which people are malicious and which people are not. The algorithm is used to solve the problem when the group of people cannot reach a consensus because they cannot trust each other.
