## Tiers of Blockchain Technology
- Blockchain 1.0 â€“ Deal with normal transactions but do not have the ability to handle smart contracts.
- Blockchain 2.0 - Deal with smart contracts but do not have the ability to handle data privacy. Ethereum is an example of this.
- Blockchain 3.0 - Applications that are built on top of Blockchain 2.0 that can handle data privacy.
  Example of Blockchain 3.0 is the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html) and [Corda](https://www.corda.net/).
